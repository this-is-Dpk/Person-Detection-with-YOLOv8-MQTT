🧠 Person Detection with YOLOv8 & MQTT

This project demonstrates real-time person detection using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and MQTT.
It consists of two scripts:

Publisher → Detects persons in video frames and publishes images to an MQTT broker.
Subscriber → Receives the images and saves them to disk automatically.
Features

✔ Real-time person detection using YOLOv8
✔ Publishes detected frames over MQTT
✔ Subscriber saves received images with timestamped filenames
✔ Auto-run subscriber on reboot using systemd
✔ Organized directory for saved images

Hardware Requirements
Any Linux device (tested on Yocto build system)
Camera (USB or CSI) for video capture
MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto running on LAN)
Software Requirements
Python 3.8+
Virtual Environment (venv) recommended
Libraries:
ultralytics
opencv-python
paho-mqtt

Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mqtt_person_detection.git
cd mqtt_person_detection


Create and activate virtual environment:

python3 -m venv yocto_venv
source yocto_venv/bin/activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run Publisher

Detects persons from camera feed and publishes images:

make run-pub

Run Subscriber

Receives and saves images into:

/home/yocto/Desktop/mqtt/subscriber/Received_pictures

make run-sub

Auto Start Subscriber on Boot

Create a systemd service file /etc/systemd/system/project1.service:

[Unit]
Description=MQTT Subscriber Auto Start
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'source /home/root/yocto_venv/bin/activate && python3 /home/root/project1.py'
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Enable the service:

sudo systemctl enable project1.service
sudo systemctl start project1.service
