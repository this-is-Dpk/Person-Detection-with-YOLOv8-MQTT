# ðŸ§  Person Detection with YOLOv8 & MQTT
This project demonstrates real-time person detection using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and MQTT.

It consists of two scripts:

Publisher â†’ Detects persons in video frames and publishes images to an MQTT broker.
Subscriber â†’ Receives the images and saves them to disk automatically.
âœ¨ Features

âœ” Real-time person detection using YOLOv8
âœ” Publishes detected frames over MQTT
âœ” Subscriber saves received images with timestamped filenames
âœ” Auto-run subscriber on reboot using systemd
âœ” Organized directory for saved images

# ðŸ–¥ Hardware Requirements
Any Linux device (tested on Yocto build system)
Camera (USB or CSI) for video capture
MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto running on LAN)

# ðŸ“¦ Software Requirements
Python 3.8+
Virtual Environment (venv) recommended
Libraries:
ultralytics
opencv-python
paho-mqtt
